%% What Is Inverse Kinematics?
% Kinematics is the science of motion. In a two-joint robotic arm, given
% the angles of the joints, the kinematics equations give the location of
% the tip of the arm. Inverse kinematics refers to the reverse process.
% Given a desired location for the tip of the robotic arm, what should the
% angles of the joints be so as to locate the tip of the arm at the desired
% location. There is usually more than one solution and can at times be a
% difficult problem to solve.
%
% This is a typical problem in robotics that needs to be solved to control
% a robotic arm to perform tasks it is designated to do. In a
% 2-dimensional input space, with a two-joint robotic arm and given the
% desired co-ordinate, the problem reduces to finding the two angles
% involved. The first angle is between the first arm and the ground (or
% whatever it is attached to). The second angle is between the first arm
% and the second arm.

%
%% Why Use Fuzzy Logic?
% For simple structures like the two-joint robotic arm, it is possible to
% mathematically deduce the angles at the joints given the desired location
% of the tip of the arm. However with more complex structures (eg: n-joint
% robotic arms operating in a 3-dimensional input space) deducing a
% mathematical solution for the inverse kinematics may prove challenging.
%
% Using fuzzy logic, we can construct a Fuzzy Inference System that deduces
% the inverse kinematics if the forward kinematics of the problem is
% known, hence sidestepping the need to develop an analytical solution.
% Also, the fuzzy solution is easily understandable and does not require
% special background knowledge to comprehend and evaluate it.
%
% In the following section, a broad outline for developing such a
% solution is described, and later, the detailed steps are elaborated.
%
%% Overview of Fuzzy Solution
%
% Since the forward kinematics formulae for the two-joint robotic arm are
% known, x and y co-ordinates of the tip of the arm are deduced for the
% entire range of angles of rotation of the two joints. The co-ordinates
% and the angles are saved to be used as training data to train ANFIS
% (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) network. 
%
% During training the ANFIS network learns to map the co-ordinates |(x,y)|
% to the angles |(theta1, theta2)|. The trained ANFIS network is then used
% as a part of a larger control system to control the robotic arm. Knowing
% the desired location of the robotic arm, the control system uses the
% trained ANFIS network to deduce the angular positions of the joints and
% applies force to the joints of the robotic arm accordingly to move it to
% the desired location. 
%
%% What Is ANFIS?
% ANFIS stands for Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. It is a hybrid
% neuro-fuzzy technique that brings learning capabilities of neural
% networks to fuzzy inference systems. The learning algorithm tunes the
% membership functions of a
% <matlab:helpview([docroot,'/toolbox/fuzzy/fuzzy.map'],'sugeno_type_fis') Sugeno-type Fuzzy Inference System> 
% using the training input-output data. 
%
% In this case, the input-output data refers to the "coordinates-angles"
% dataset. The coordinates act as input to the ANFIS and the angles act as
% the output. The learning algorithm "teaches" the ANFIS to map the
% co-ordinates to the angles through a process called training. At the end
% of training, the trained ANFIS network would have learned the
% input-output map and be ready to be deployed into the larger control
% system solution.
%
%% Data Generation
% Let |theta1| be the angle between the first arm and the ground. Let
% |theta2| be the angle between the second arm and the first arm (Refer to
% Figure 1 for illustration). Let the length of the first arm be |l1| and
% that of the second arm be |l2|. 
%
% Let us assume that the first joint has limited freedom to rotate and it
% can rotate between 0 and 90 degrees. Similarly, assume that the second
% joint has limited freedom to rotate and can rotate between 0 and 180
% degrees. (This assumption takes away the need to handle some special
% cases which will confuse the discourse). Hence, |0<=theta1<=pi/2| and
% |0<=theta2<=pi|.
%

% *Figure 2:* Illustration showing all possible |theta1| and |theta2|
% values.
%
% Now, for every combination of |theta1| and |theta2| values the x and y
% coordinates are deduced using forward kinematics formulae.
%%
% The following code snippet shows how data is generated for all
% combination of |theta1| and |theta2| values and saved into a matrix to be
% used as training data. The reason for saving the data in two matrices is
% explained in the following section.

l1 = 10; % length of first arm
l2 = 7; % length of second arm

theta1 = 0:0.2:pi/2; % all possible theta1 values
theta2 = 0:0.2:pi; % all possible theta2 values

[THETA1, THETA2] = ndgrid(theta1, theta2); % generate a grid of theta1 and theta2 values

X = l1 * cos(THETA1) + l2 * cos(THETA1 + THETA2); % compute x coordinates
Y = l1 * sin(THETA1) + l2 * sin(THETA1 + THETA2); % compute y coordinates

data1 = [X(:) Y(:) THETA1(:)]; % create x-y-theta1 dataset
data2 = [X(:) Y(:) THETA2(:)]; % create x-y-theta2 dataset

% The following plot shows all the X-Y data points generated by cycling
% through different combinations of |theta1| and |theta2| and deducing x
% and y co-ordinates for each. The plot can be generated by using the
% code-snippet shown below. The plot is illustrated further for easier
% understanding.

%
%% Building ANFIS Networks
% One approach to building an ANFIS solution for this problem, is to build
% two ANFIS networks, one to predict |theta1| and the other to predict
% |theta2|.
%
% In order for the ANFIS networks to be able to predict the angles they have
% to be trained with sample input-output data. The first ANFIS network will
% be trained with X and Y coordinates as input and corresponding |theta1|
% values as output. The matrix |data1| contains the |x-y-theta1| dataset
% required to train the first ANFIS network. Therefore |data1| will be used
% as the dataset to train the first ANFIS network. 
%
% Similarly, the second ANFIS network will be trained with X and Y
% coordinates as input and corresponding |theta2| values as output. The
% matrix |data2| contains the |x-y-theta2| dataset required to train the
% second ANFIS network. Therefore |data2| will be used as the dataset to
% train the second ANFIS network. 
%
% |anfis| is the function that is used to train an ANFIS network. There are
% several syntaxes to the function. If called with the following syntax,
% |anfis| automatically creates a Sugeno-type FIS and trains it using the
% training data passed to the function.
%
% The following code may take a couple of minutes to run:
fprintf('-->%s\n','Start training first ANFIS network. It may take one minute depending on your computer system.')
anfis1 = anfis(data1, 10, [350,0,.001,.9,1.1], [0,0,0,0]); % train first ANFIS network
fprintf('-->%s\n','Start training second ANFIS network. It may take one minute depending on your computer system.')
anfis2 = anfis(data2, 6, 250, [0,0,0,0]); % train second ANFIS network

%%
% The first parameter to |anfis| is the training data, the second parameter
% is the number of membership functions used to characterize each input and
% output, the third parameter is the number of training <#23 epochs> and
% the last parameter is the options to display progress during training.
% The values for number of epochs and the number of membership functions
% have been arrived at after a fair amount of experimentation with
% different values.
%
% The toolbox comes with GUI's that helps build and experiment with ANFIS
% networks.
%
% |anfis1| and |anfis2| represent the two trained ANFIS networks that
% will be deployed in the larger control system.
%
% Once the training is complete, the two ANFIS networks would have learned
% to approximate the angles (|theta1, theta2|) as a function of the
% coordinates (|x, y|). One advantage of using the fuzzy approach is that
% the ANFIS network would now approximate the angles for coordinates that
% are similar but not exactly the same as it was trained with. For example,
% the trained ANFIS networks are now capable of approximating the angles
% for coordinates that lie between two points that were included in the
% training dataset. This will allow the final controller to move the arm
% smoothly in the input space. 
% 
% We now have two trained ANFIS networks which are ready to be deployed
% into the larger system that will utilize these networks to control the
% robotic arms.
% 
%% Validating the ANFIS Networks
% 
% Having trained the networks, an important follow up step is to validate the
% networks to determine how well the ANFIS networks would perform inside
% the larger control system.
%
% Since this demo problem deals with a two-joint robotic arm whose inverse
% kinematics formulae can be derived, it is possible to test the answers
% that the ANFIS networks produce with the answers from the derived
% formulae.
%
% Let's assume that it is important for the ANFIS networks to have low
% errors within the operating range |0<x<2| and |8<y<10|.
%

x = 0:0.1:2; % x coordinates for validation
y = 8:0.1:10; % y coordinates for validation

%%
% The |theta1| and |theta2| values are deduced mathematically from the x
% and y coordinates using inverse kinematics formulae.

[X, Y] = ndgrid(x,y);

c2 = (X.^2 + Y.^2 - l1^2 - l2^2)/(2*l1*l2);
s2 = sqrt(1 - c2.^2);
THETA2D = atan2(s2, c2); % theta2 is deduced

k1 = l1 + l2.*c2;
k2 = l2*s2;
THETA1D = atan2(Y, X) - atan2(k2, k1); % theta1 is deduced

%%
% <matlab:edit('traininv') Click here for unvectorized code>
%%
% |THETA1D| and |THETA2D| are the variables that hold the values of
% |theta1| and |theta2| deduced using the inverse kinematics formulae.
%
% |theta1| and |theta2| values predicted by the trained anfis networks
% are obtained by using the command |evalfis| which evaluates a FIS for the
% given inputs.
%
% Here, |evalfis| is used to find out the FIS outputs for the same x-y
% values used earlier in the inverse kinematics formulae.

XY = [X(:) Y(:)];
THETA1P = evalfis(XY, anfis1); % theta1 predicted by anfis1
THETA2P = evalfis(XY, anfis2); % theta2 predicted by anfis2

%%
% Now, we can see how close the FIS outputs are with respect to the
% deduced values.

theta1diff = THETA1D(:) - THETA1P;
theta2diff = THETA2D(:) - THETA2P;

subplot(2,1,1);
plot(theta1diff);
ylabel('THETA1D - THETA1P')
title('Deduced theta1 - Predicted theta1')

subplot(2,1,2);
plot(theta2diff);
ylabel('THETA2D - THETA2P')
title('Deduced theta2 - Predicted theta2')

%%
% The errors are in the |1e-3| range which is a fairly good number for the
% application it is being used in. However this may not be acceptable for
% another application, in which case the parameters to the |anfis| function
% may be tweaked until an acceptable solution is arrived at. Also, other
% techniques like input selection and alternate ways to model the problem
% may be explored.

%% Building a Solution Around the Trained ANFIS Networks
%
% Now given a specific task, such as robots picking up an object in an
% assembly line, the larger control system will use the trained ANFIS
% networks as a reference, much like a lookup table, to determine what the
% angles of the arms must be, given a desired location for the tip of the
% arm. Knowing the desired angles and the current angles of the joints, 
% the system will apply force appropriately on the joints of the arms to
% move them towards the desired location.
%
% The <matlab:invkine invkine> command launches a GUI that demonstrates how the two 
% trained ANFIS networks perform when asked to trace an ellipse. 
%
% <<../invkine_gui.png>>
%%
% *Figure 4:* Demo GUI for Inverse Kinematics Modeling.

%%
% The two ANFIS networks used in the demo have been pre-trained and are
% deployed into a larger system that controls the tip of the two-joint
% robot arm to trace an ellipse in the input space.
%
% The ellipse to be traced can be moved around. Move the ellipse to a
% slightly different location and observe how the system responds by moving
% the tip of the robotic arm from its current location to the closest
% point on the new location of the ellipse. Also observe that the system
% responds smoothly as long as the ellipse to be traced lies within the 'x'
% marked spots which represent the data grid that was used to train the
% networks. Once the ellipse is moved outside the range of data it was
% trained with, the ANFIS networks respond unpredictably. This emphasizes
% the importance of having relevant and representative data for training.
% Data must be generated based on the expected range of operation to avoid
% such unpredictability and instability issues.
